How to test HubArchiveCreator?
==============================

The Galaxy tool HubArchiveCreator, which is currently mandatory for G-OnRamp,
can go through unit testing, and has been developed with TDD (Test Driven Development)
method.

Unfortunately, the UCSC Track Hub testing part has not yet been implemented. Thus, the UCSC Track Hub
<=> G-OnRamp connection needs currently to be manually tested.

Let's proceed to the documentation of how to test the HubArchiveCreator tool:
