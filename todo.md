HubArchiveCreator's TODO

# TODO file inspired from: http://lifehacker.com/why-a-github-gist-is-my-favorite-to-do-list-1493063613

- [ ] Add a class named AugustusProcess: Process the Augustus output to BigBed (and others needed in TrackHub) and (create folders + add the files into the right location => Process can be ported in a class responsible for that) 
- [ ] Add a class named TrfBigProcess
- [ ] Add a class named ZipCreation: Create the base TrackHub hierarchy
- [ ] Rename AugustusProcess into something more generic if the process is shared (gtf to BigBed)
