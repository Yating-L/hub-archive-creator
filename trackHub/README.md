This folder exists to configure Galaxy to handle the files generated by HubArchiveCreator tool

* The **content** of datatypes_conf.xml should go inside config/datatypes_conf.xml, under \<registration\> (Copy config/datatypes_conf.xml.sample to config/datatypes_conf.xml if it does not exist yet)
* The content of tracks_partial.py should go inside `lib/galaxy/datatypes/tracks.py`
* trackhub.xml should go inside display_application/ucsc/


TODO:

- [x] Create a script to copy all these files directly into galaxy => Done but not usable now I have changed the datatype to match Galaxy IUC
- [ ] Need to modify the script `util/add_datatype.py` to match the changes introduced in https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy/pull/2348
- [x] Create a package in ToolShed that install directly this when installing HubArchiveCreator => Not recommended by Galaxy IUC and team
